## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

For answers to the questions listed in the assignment description please visit the [Assignement](./ASSIGNMENT.md) file.

Information about how are code works goes here

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
* Linux
* gcc-dlx
* dlxsim
* dlxasm

### Installing
Simply, unzip and run given you have the required programs

```
unzip ee469lab3_g24.tar.gz
gcc-dlx -mtraps -O3 -Wall -c -o foo.o foo.c #TODO-is this correct Compiling Step
#TODO-is this correct run (dlxsim) Step
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

```
chmod u+x
make.sh -R q2
```
Run each process (q2, q3, and q5) with the commands above from the DLXOS folder. Alternatively, you could cd into the project's respective directory under the DLXOS/apps folder and run

```
make
make run
```

To clean, run "make clean" from any project folder, or simply run "make.sh -c" from the DLXOS folder.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.

### WARNING
* before you exit from ssh session: Please make sure that you copy the contents of your tmp folder into your home for backup

        cp -r /tmp/$USER/ee469 ~/

* When you login again to ecegrid, you can restore your work to tmp as:

        cp -r ~/ee469 /tmp/$USER/"

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
