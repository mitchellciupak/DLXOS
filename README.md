## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
* Linux
* gcc-dlx
* dlxsim
* dlxasm

### Installing
Simply, unzip and run given you have the required programs

```
unzip ee469lab4_g24.zip

```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
This repository actually contains three OS's. The first OS deals with questions 1 and 2 of lab 4. To run these tests, change directories (cd) into one-level and execute the following commands:

### Running One-level
```
chmod u+x make.sh
make.sh -R q2
```
This will run the tests for question 2 on a one-level system.

### Running Fork
To run the test for fork, cd into fork and execute the following commands:
```
chmod u+x make.sh
make.sh -R q2
```

### Running Heap
To run the test for heap, cd into heap and execute the following commands:
```
chmod u+x make.sh
make.sh -R tests
```
To view the heap after each allocation and free, enter debug mode by executing:
```
make.sh -D tests
```
The flag "-D h" will run the fancyPrint function and display heaps.

### Additional Information

Note that in any OS, you can always cd into the os folder and run
```
make
make run
```
and then cd into the folder of the application you wish to run and run
```
make
make run
```

To clean, run "make clean" from any project folder, or simply run "make.sh -c" from the heap, fork, or one-level folders.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.

### WARNING
* before you exit from ssh session: Please make sure that you copy the contents of your tmp folder into your home for backup

        cp -r /tmp/$USER/ee469 ~/

* When you login again to ecegrid, you can restore your work to tmp as:

        cp -r ~/ee469 /tmp/$USER/"
